  o Minor features (hidden service):
    - Add the new options "HiddenServiceMaxStreams" and
      "HiddenServiceMaxStreamsCloseCircuit" to allow hidden services to limit
      the maximum number of streams per circuit, and optionally tear down the
      circuit when the limit is exceeded. Part of ticket 16052.
